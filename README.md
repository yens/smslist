smslist
=======
This is a simple bash script to allow mailinglist-style communication via SMS.

Dependencies
------------
The script requires "formail" from the [procmail](http://www.procmail.org/)
toolbox, [smstools3](http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/) from which it is
intended to be run, it expects the sendsms script from smstools3 to be in
PATH. SQLite3 is used to store a list of users and possibly some other runtime
configuration in the future.

Contribute!
-----------
Contributions are more than welcome, I'm not a very experienced programmer and
would appreciate any cleanups, stylistic tips, bugfixes and cool new features.
Especially when they come with good descriptions, so I can learn something :)
